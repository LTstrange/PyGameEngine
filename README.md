# PyGameEngine
A opensource game engine base on python and Pygame.

###### Why we need PyGameEngine?

Obviously, using Pygame to make games is simple and easy to use, and the function of Pygame is also very powerful. You can use Pygame and python to make any graphical software. And, most importantly, Pygame is very friendly to novices. You can use Pygame flexibly with little programming knowledge.

There is another reason to use Pygame. Pygame allows us to build a game (software) from 0. It allows us to know every part of the game (software), and each part can directly see the source code, so as to modify it and adjust it to own code components.

However, Pygame has only the most basic components. It needs to implement all kinds of parts you want, such as buttons, text boxes, physics engine, and so on. The novice has to implement these components himself, which hinders him from making his own game (software). Only when you use Pygame for a long time and make every part you need bit by bit can you make a complete game (software), which obviously takes a lot of time.

Secondly, so many people use Pygame , and so many people have implemented a large number of efficient and easy-to-use components. Sometimes we just want to use these components instead of rewriting them ourselves. But as mentioned earlier, one of the reasons why we use Pygame is that we want to master every line of code in the project and understand the implementation of each component.

Obviously, an open source Pygame component implementation library can solve this problem well. PyGameEngine was created for this purpose.

###### PyGameEngine aims:

PyGameEngine hopes to provide a comprehensive and self consistent system, and each component in the system can be easily used independently. Under the same system, these components jointly organize a complete game engine.

If you are a novice, you can download the whole project and fill the main frame with the effect you want to achieve according to the sample. Use the components provided by PyGameEngine to easily make the game you want.

If you are familiar with the use of Pygame, but suffer from building wheels repeatedly. You can also find the component which you want. Then copy the code and paste it directly into your project. With a little modification, you can make a complete and flexible component available to your project.

If you are a Pygame expert, you can also refer to the components made by others to improve your own components. Alternatively, you can submit your carefully crafted components to PyGameEngine. Thank you very much for your contribution to PyGameEngine!



Now a day, PyGameEngine is just my simple idea, and it is very  simple and crude, and the system of the whole project is not mature enough. Therefore, you are very welcome to inject vitality into this new project. I hope that with the joint efforts of you and me, PyGameEngine can become easier to use and more people can feel the charm of Pygame.
